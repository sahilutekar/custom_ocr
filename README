License Plate Recognizer
The License Plate Recognizer is a simple Python script that can detect and recognize license plates in an image using OpenCV and a convolutional neural network. This can be useful for automating tasks that involve processing images of license plates, such as parking management systems, toll systems, and traffic monitoring.
Requirements
The following software packages are required to run the License Plate Recognizer:
•	Python 3.6 or higher
•	OpenCV
•	Numpy
•	TensorFlow
How it works
The License Plate Recognizer works in the following way:
1.	The image is loaded from the specified path and preprocessed to enhance the contrast and remove noise.
2.	Connected components in the image are identified using morphological operations, and components that are likely to contain license plate characters are filtered based on their size and aspect ratio.
3.	The filtered components are sorted from left to right and top to bottom.
4.	Each filtered component is cropped from the image and resized to a fixed size, and padding is added to make it fit for the neural network.
5.	The cropped and padded image is passed through a convolutional neural network to recognize the character in the image.
6.	The recognized characters are combined to form the license plate number.

For running the code 
edit the main.py change image path and model path  then 
python main.py
